PepsiCo  
SASB Index  
2021

The information within this PDF 
is accurate as of June 28, 2022.

This report marks the second time PepsiCo has reported in alignment with the Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards. We have reported the disclosures related to the two 
sectors that are most closely aligned to our business: Processed Foods and Non-Alcoholic Beverages. 
In certain instances, and as noted throughout this index, a specific SASB topic may be discussed 
generally in our ESG Report but we do not report on the corresponding SASB metric. In addition, certain 
disclosures may not be fully aligned with SASB’s definition, but represent the closest approximation 
possible. Unless otherwise noted, our sustainability data reflects progress made during the calendar 
year (ending December 31), whereas our financial reporting corresponds with our fiscal year, which 
varies slightly from year-to-year. We are constantly evaluating our goals and progress, assessing the 
technical and regulatory challenges we face in achieving our ambitious objectives, and innovating new 
ways to keep moving forward, which may impact goals referenced in this index. Inclusion of information 
in this index should not be construed as a characterization of the materiality or financial impact of 
that information. Please see our Form 10-K for the financial year ended December 25, 2021 and other 
publicly-filed documents, which are available at www.pepsico.com/investors/investor-relations.

1 Results reflect exclusion of Be & Cheery portfolio

PepsiCo has set a goal that by 2025, 
≥ 67% of beverage portfolio volume in 
its Top 26 beverage markets will have 
≤100 Calories from added sugars per 
12oz. serving. 

In 2021, 53% of our global beverages 
volume met this goal. During the year, 
the Top 26 markets represented 79% 
of global beverage volume.

PepsiCo has set goals that by 2025, 
≥ 75% of convenient foods portfolio 
volume in its Top 23 convenient foods 
markets will not exceed 1.3 milligrams 
of sodium per Calorie, or 1.1 grams of 
saturated fat per 100 Calories. 

In 2021, 66%1 of convenient foods 
portfolio volume met the sodium 
goal, and 75%1 met the saturated 
fat goal. During the year, the Top 23 
markets represented 86% of global 
convenient foods volume.

To help provide nutrition guidance 
during the development of our 
beverages and foods, and diversify our 
product portfolio in the process, we 
deploy the PepsiCo Nutrition Criteria 
(PNC). These science-based criteria 
are based on recommendations 
for food and nutrient intake from 
leading global and national nutrition 
authorities including the World Health 
Organization, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, the National Academy of 
Medicine, and national public health 
authorities. The PNC set standards for 
nutrients to limit as well as nutrients 
and food groups to encourage that 
are based on the latest science and 
country specific dietary guidelines. 
See ESG Topics A-Z for more on how we 
manage nutrition and product safety 
and quality.

PepsiCo is committed to marketing 
our products responsibly to all 
consumers, and recognizes the need 
for special guardrails around whether 
and how we market our products to 
children. Our marketers are bound by 
PepsiCo’s Global Policy on Responsible 
Advertising and Marketing to Children, 
as well as all relevant local pledge 
programs, laws, and regulations.

PepsiCo ensures that products 
containing bioengineered materials 
comply with local regulations for 
their use, including any labeling 
requirements. We want consumers to 
have clear and helpful information 
about their foods and beverages and 
believe that any labeling standards 
established in this regard should 
be clear and consistent so that 
consumers can better understand 
the safety, prevalence, and benefits 
of bioengineered ingredients and can 
make informed choices for themselves 
and their families. 

We do not currently track revenue

ESG Topics A-Z: Packaging

PepsiCo aims to use 50% recycled 
content in its plastic packaging by 
2030. Across our global company-
owned and franchise beverage 
operations in 2021, PepsiCo used 6% 
recycled plastic in its plastic packaging.

PepsiCo has set a goal to design 
100% of packaging to be recyclable, 
compostable, biodegradable or 
reusable by 2025. In 2021, 87% of our 
packaging met this requirement. 

Our vision is A World Where Packaging 
Never Becomes Waste. As we pursue 
our ambition to build a circular 
economy, we are working on a broad 
set of initiatives to introduce more 
sustainable packaging, develop 
appropriate end-of-life solutions, 
improve the carbon footprint of 
our packaging, as well as other 
environmental impacts, and ensure 
protection of human rights especially 
in the informal recycling sector. For 
more on our efforts to reduce the 
impact of our packaging, see ESG 
Topics A-Z: Packaging.

As of the end of 2021, 99% of  
company-owned facilities achieved 
certification from a GFSI-recognized 
certification program owner such 
as Food Safety System Certification 
(FSSC) 22000. Most were to a GFSI 
benchmarked standard, however  
due to COVID-19 some were 
conducted remotely.

PepsiCo has strong global quality and 
food safety standards. We use qualified 
ingredients, approved suppliers and 
follow all applicable regulations issued 
by regulatory authorities. Our products 
are traceable, which enables us to 
quickly investigate and address any 
potential concerns in the marketplace. 
Our facilities conduct mock recalls 
on at least an annual basis to ensure 
readiness to respond to any incident. 
On the rare occasions when incidents 
occur, we take quick action, conduct 
robust investigations, implement 
corrective actions and share learnings 
across the system.

1 We increased our sourcing through the RSPO Mass Balance physically certified supply chain model and 
procured de minimis Independent Smallholder Credits to achieve 100% RSPO certification in 2021.

In 2021, we achieved 100%  
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil 
physically-certified palm oil and 100% 
Bonsucro certified sustainable cane 
sugar globally.1

Approximately 50% of our key 
ingredients were sustainably-sourced, 
including more than 90% of grower-
sourced crops. For grower-sourced 
crops, sustainable sourcing refers to 
meeting the independently verified 
environmental, social and economic 
principles of PepsiCo’s Sustainable 
Farming Program (SFP). For supplier-
sourced crops, sustainable sourcing 
is achieved through a third party 
standard that has been benchmarked 
as equivalent to the SFP or, in limited 
regions, a continuous improvement 
program addressing the main 
environmental and social risks with 
growing the relevant crop.

In 2021, more than 900 on-site audits 
or virtual assessments were conducted 
with first-tier suppliers using the 
industry standard SMETA 4-Pillar Audit 
Protocol or an equivalent assessment. 
Among our Tier 1 strategic suppliers in 
2021, the non-conformance rate for 
suppliers with highest risk — red audit 
results — was just over 8% of our total 
assessments. 

At the year-end, corrective action 
plans had been developed for 100% of 
the ‘red sites’ which will be validated 
by an auditor at their next on-site 
follow-up audit.

Making our products requires a wide

and we believe that regenerative 
agricultural practices will be pivotal 
in meeting the increasing demand for 
food, while also addressing some of 
the key risks that can be associated 
with agriculture, such as freshwater 
scarcity, deforestation, biodiversity 
loss, soil degradation, and human 
rights. For a list of our key ingredients,
