INTRODUCTION

Jeffrey L. Harmening
Chairman, Chief 
Executive Officer
General Mills

To our stakeholders

For more than 150 years, General Mills 

Addressing inequality

has been making food the world loves. 

For us that has always meant ensuring 

our food is a reflection of our ability 

to do good for our people, planet and 

communities. That central mission is at 

the heart of General Mills — and was 

never more important than it was in 2021.  

Putting people first

In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our 

employees met the moment with resolve. 

They understood that under normal 

circumstances we dedicate ourselves to 

make food the world loves — but in the 

pandemic, we are also making food the 

world needs. We appreciate that millions 

of families are nourished by our food. So 

when disruptions in the global supply 

chain came, we committed ourselves to 

innovative and creative new approaches 

to ensure we could successfully deliver to 

meet our consumers’ needs — and we did.  

We also continued our commitment to 

use our scale to drive sustainable and 

meaningful change on issues of racial 

and social injustice. We come to the 

table humble, understanding these are 

broad and complex issues. But we also 

come with resolve knowing that we 

have to be part of a larger collective 

effort if we hope to make significant 

progress in this space. We have made 

progress to target racial disparities in 

food security and its disproportionate 

impacts on communities of color, 

support nonprofit organizations that 

are working to bring about equity in 

education, and address representation 

and access opportunities within our 

own workforce. For example, through 

our Box Tops for Education program 

we are equipping teachers to identify 

and address racial bias, supporting 

programs to increase the number of 

Our focus on putting people first extends 

teachers of color, and distributing funds 

beyond our consumers to across our

entire value chain… the farmers who 

headquarters community in Minnesota. 

General Mills is leading the industry 

in advancing regenerative agriculture 

by partnering with farmers, advancing 

science, and measuring outcomes. We 

see regenerative agriculture driving 

significant impact on planetary 

health, people and in reaching our 

2030 and 2050 climate targets.  

In our 52nd year of reporting social 

and environmental performance to 

stakeholders, we remain committed 

to disclosing our progress, as well 

as our challenges. We continue to 

support key global efforts to advance 

the sustainability agenda, including 

the United Nations Global Compact, 

which we have endorsed since 2008. 

While plenty of work remains to be 

done, we are optimistic. I am incredibly 

proud of the General Mills team that 

shows up every day with passion, care 

and ingenuity.  We are inspired by the 

past and energized by the future we 

are shaping together. We understand 

we have a role to play — and we are 

more determined than ever to ensure 

the G in General Mills stands for Good. 

grow our ingredients, our employees, 

who are the heartbeat of General Mills 

and, of course, the communities we 

are proud to be a part of and serve. 

We took additional steps in 2021 to 

provide our employees with a safe 

workplace, to support their mental 

health and well-being, and to foster a 

culture of inclusion and belonging, so 

that employees could bring their unique 

selves to work every day and thrive.  

Regenerating our planet 

As extreme weather events occur 

with greater intensity and frequency 

Sincerely,

around the world — with devastating 

effects on people and the natural 

resources necessary to produce 

food — we recognize that adopting 

more sustainable practices is not 

enough. We instead need to regenerate

the world’s resources to strengthen 

ecosystems and community resilience.

our approach in the Public Policy for 

the Greater Good area of our website. 

Our public policy priorities include: 

n    Protecting and preserving our planet: 
w  Leading on regenerative agriculture
and soil health – General Mills is 

a leading voice on regenerative 

agriculture. We invest to help 

support farmers as they shift 

toward more sustainable practices 

and encourage collaboration and 

investment by governments and 

the private sector, such as our 

support for the Foundation for 

Food and Ag Research (FFAR), a 

critical facilitator of public private 

partnerships between industry 

and farmers. Policy is a critical 

tool to advance this work. We also 

encourage the U.S. Congress to 

strengthen collaboration between 

w  Combating climate change – We

have established industry-leading, 

science-based targets for carbon 

reduction and advocate for climate 

change policies: we support a

action; have publicly called for the 

U.S. to remain in the Paris Climate 

Accord; and support the U.S. 

Environmental Protection Agency’s 

(EPA) Clean Power Plan. See a 

list of our public actions here.

w  Supporting stronger organic

standards – We work to promote 

and protect the integrity of 

organic standards and advance 

their continuous improvement. 

Learn about our support for 

the National Organic Standards 

Board (NOSB) and the Organic 

Agriculture Research and 

Extension Initiative (OREI).

w  Advancing water stewardship –
We engage policymakers to 

drive more sustainable water 

practices in key watersheds, 

like California and Kansas.

w  Addressing packaging and food
waste – We promote policies to 

effectively and efficiently increase 

packaging recycling rates and 

reduce waste. In the U.S., we are a 

Modernization Act (FSMA) and 

its goal of raising food safety 

standards across the food value 

chain. We have consistently called 

on Congress to continue adequate 

funding for FSMA implementation.

Nutrient-dense foods
Nutrient density is the contribution of 

positive nutrients and food groups, and 

nutrients to limit, per calorie. At General 

Mills, we provide a diverse portfolio 

of products, including many nutrient-

dense foods, that can help consumers 

meet dietary recommendations 

and build healthy eating patterns. 

Focusing on nutrient density — 

rather than just what nutrients have 

been increased or reduced — can 

help best support consumers in 

while balancing nutrients to limit, such 

as sodium, sugar and saturated fat.

Fortification: We fortify key products 
in line with public health principles 

including using evidence-based 

decision-making to help guide the use 

School meals

During the COVID-19 pandemic, General Mills has supported schools with grab-and-

go solutions, such as whole grain–rich cereals in bowlpaks and cups and individually 

wrapped whole grain–rich pancakes and waffles. We also accelerated new product 

innovation for grab-and-go feeding programs, including the introduction of Nature Valley

nutrient-dense foods that people love. 

Nutrient-dense foods — like fortified 

whole grain cereals, low-fat and nonfat 

yogurts, granola bars, and frozen fruits 

and vegetables — play an important 

role in healthy diets. They are important 

contributors to consumption of key 

food groups, including whole grain,

vitamins, minerals, protein and fiber,

Product reformulation highlights

Many Americans fall short on calcium 

and vitamin D in their diet. To help 

address this gap, most flavors of Original 

Style Yoplait were reformulated to 

provide an excellent source of calcium 

and a good source of vitamin D.

The nutrition profile of Light Style Yoplait 

also underwent a change. Yoplait Light 

yogurts now provide 80 calories, 7 grams 

total sugar and 1 gram of added sugar 

(down from 90 calories, 10 grams total 

sugar and 4 grams of added sugar).

In Mexico, we reduced added sugar 

by 78% in our Nature Valley Fruteria 

snack bar and added 13 grams 

of fiber per 100 grams. With this 

formulation improvement, whole grain 

oats are now the first ingredient.

Sustainable diets
The World Health Organization has 

identified Sustainable Healthy Diets 

as dietary patterns that promote an 

individual’s health and well-being; have 

low environmental pressure and impact; 

are accessible, affordable, safe and 

equitable; and are culturally acceptable. 

General Mills supports this perspective, 

and we are focused on providing 

nutrient-dense foods that contribute 

healthful ingredients, including whole 

grains and low-fat dairy, to the diet. 

We also invest in regenerative 

agriculture to reduce environmental 

impact, restore soil health, and support 

farming communities. Our packaging 

team continually explores renewable 

materials and new opportunities to 

reduce packaging while keeping foods 

fresh. Learn more about how General

Personalized nutrition 
As consumers’ desire for personalized 

nutrition expands, General Mills is 

working to provide innovative offerings. 

Our diverse portfolio includes many 

products designed to meet the evolving 

preferences of consumers who choose 

their foods with specific nutrition and 

lifestyle goals in mind. Examples include:

n   Carb-conscious – Our Ratio brand 
extended its keto-friendly product 

offerings to include dairy snacks and 

soft bakes with net carbs in mind. 

Good Measure offers snack bars —  

convenient snack solutions that 

provide fiber and nuts and have  

5 grams or less of net carbs —  

as an occasional snack for 

consumers interested in limiting 

their carbohydrate consumption. 

Wonderworks is the newest cereal 

brand from General Mills, with  

3 grams of net carbs and  

17 grams of protein per serving. 

n   Weight management – Fiber One 

bars and brownies are smart choices 

for consumers looking for tasty 

ways to enjoy their favorite snacks 

while managing their weight. Our 

Yoplait Light brand has been a 

calorie-controlled yogurt for years 

and was recently reformulated to 

have less sugar and fewer calories.

n   Heart-healthy – Cheerios Original 

and Honey Nut Cheerios, staples in 

many households, are made from 

whole grain oats, which contain 

beta-glucan, a soluble fiber that 

can help lower cholesterol as 

part of a heart-healthy diet.

n   Gluten-free – We offer many gluten- 
free products. General Mills is the 

third-largest producer of gluten-free 

products in the U.S.* More than one in

Date labeling
In the U.S., General Mills supports product labeling changes to help 

reduce food waste through clearer guidance for consumers about 

food shelf life. We have updated all of our U.S. product packaging 

to comply with this voluntary date-labeling initiative that uses 

standard nomenclature to reduce consumer confusion. Learn more

The enhanced commitments included 

an expansion of IFBA’s global marketing

advertising, specifying that members 

would only advertise products that meet

Aside from these global commitments, 

at local levels we fully comply with the 

applicable local programs, including the 

EU Pledge in Europe, CAI in Canada 

and CFBAI in the U.S.* Our compliance 

track record with these programs 

is extraordinarily strong. CFBAI, in 

particular, publishes a report annually 

that addresses the compliance of all of 

its participants. We are not aware of any 

instance of noncompliance by General 

Mills in the past several years, and 

CFBAI has confirmed this in its reports. 

In the unlikely event of any instance 

of noncompliance, a core function of 

our Responsible Marketing Council 

would be to address such issues and 

determine appropriate corrective action. 

Beyond our commitments under the 

programs noted above, we have made 

additional responsible marketing 

commitments that exceed industry

Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) develops voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies to provide information to stakeholders. 

General Mills supports this initiative and is committed to providing our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. A summary of our approach to each of the key pillars can 

be found below. Additional details on how we address the recommendations can be found in the TCFD index on our website and in our CDP Climate disclosure. 

Governance
The Board’s Public Responsibility Committee provides oversight of the company’s 

sustainability work — including our climate program. In addition, our Chairman  

and CEO convenes the Global Impact Governance Committee at least three  

times each year to review and approve climate-related strategies, programs  

and key investments.

As more than 85% of our overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occur

General Mills Policy on Climate outlines our approach to mitigation, adaptation, 

disclosure and advocacy.

In alignment with the new SBTi 1.5°C guidance, General Mills will reduce absolute GHG 

emissions across our full value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 30% by 2030 (compared

resiliency to climate shocks.

WATER MANAGEMENT:  
Regenerative agriculture helps maximize  
water infiltration and use efficiency, and can  
reduce agriculture’s impact on water quality,  
helping to protect and restore clean water in  
nearby streams, rivers and lakes.

SOIL HEALTH: Soil is a complex ecosystem that forms 
the base of the food chain for humans and land animals. 
It plays an essential role in cleaning and storing water, 
supporting biodiversity and regulating the climate.

We have multiple workstreams underway 

to accelerate the implementation of 

regenerative agriculture principles:

Pilot programs: To advance adoption 
of regenerative agriculture, we have 

partnered with Soil Health Academy 

and Understanding Ag to activate pilots 

across three of our priority ingredient 

sourcing regions (see map). Each of these 

pilots provide farmers with practical tools 

to implement regenerative agriculture 

including one-on-one coaching and 

technical assistance for three years, 

customized plans for implementation 

in their operations, soil health testing, 

farmer networking communities, access 

to regenerative agriculture workshops, 

and biodiversity and economic 

assessments to demonstrate impact 

on outcomes over time. Learn more.

We are also collaborating with leading 

conservation organizations within 

our key regions that — combined 

with the pilots — help to drive further 

progress in advancing regenerative 

agriculture systems. These include:

and nurture ecosystems. Ecosystems, 

including the farms that grow our 

ingredients, rely on a healthy global and 

local water cycle. So as a food company, 

General Mills too depends on water. On 

average, agriculture accounts for 70% of 

global freshwater withdrawals, and the 

food sector faces increasing risks related 

to water quality and availability. This 

underscores the leadership role General 

Mills and other food companies must 

take to address water stewardship issues. 

The General Mills Water Policy  

provides a framework for engaging  

with stakeholders and improving  

the health of watersheds that are

Our approach 
Water issues are local, so we take 

a risk-based approach to address 

risks in priority watersheds across 

our global supply chain.

Through an updated and expanded 

water risk assessment conducted 

in 2019–2020, we assessed 20 key 

ingredients in 45 sourcing regions 

and 255 facilities (including 208 in our 

external supply chain), covering 60 

major watershed basins and 221 minor 

watershed subbasins globally. This 

process included factors such as water 

quantity, water quality and reputation. 

We used the World Resources Institute 

(WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas 

and World Wildlife Fund (WWF) 

Water Risk Filter in this assessment.

Based on this assessment, we 

identified 10 priority watersheds as 

the most material and at-risk (see 

map). Within these watersheds, 

we consider two types of risks:

Acute risks are tied to specific 

locations, where we are focused 

on risk mitigation by supporting 

key NGO partners implementing 

watershed health strategies. 

Widespread/diffuse risks are 

broader in geographic scope and 

not easily traceable to specific 

Acute

Packaging

Our approach 
Packaging plays a critical role in 

preserving the safety, nutrition and 

quality of the food we make. It presents 

challenges in terms of raw materials 

used in production as well as the waste 

generated when improper disposal 

occurs. Packaging is also the top 

sustainability issue with consumers.

General Mills works to reduce the 

environmental impact of packaging 

by increasing use of recycled and 

recyclable materials, innovating 

to make our materials better, and 

leading through external collaboration. 

We are focused on protecting the 

attributes of the food while giving 

consumers a positive experience 

with our packaging, from shelf to 

bin. Given the many different types of 

packaging in our products, innovation 

in this space requires significant 

time, investment and collaboration. 

Ambition: Our packaging ambition is 
that all General Mills brands will design 

100% of packaging to be recyclable or 

reusable by 2030.

Progress: Through fiscal 2021, 89% of our 
packaging was recyclable (by weight). 

Our actions:

n   100% of our fiber packaging is from 
sustainable sources, using either 

recycled materials or virgin wood

****General Mills follows the Food Loss & Waste Protocol Standard when defining “food waste.” Numbers do not include waste generated from Pet plants, waste going to animal feed or inedible byproducts.

A multifaceted approach to rescue food
As a global food company, General Mills believes that food loss and waste are major environmental and economic challenges that undermine food security, contribute to climate change, unnecessarily 
consume natural resources, like water, and add more costs to families, communities and businesses alike. 

Operations

Industry

Food retailers

Communities

We closely monitor and manage our 
production processes to keep surplus 
food out of the waste stream. Surplus 
food from our operations is first offered 
to food bank partners to feed hungry 
people; the remainder is repurposed for 
animal feed or anaerobic digestion. In fiscal 
2021, 0.5% of our total production volume 
was food waste. In addition, 11 facilities 
(28% of the global total) met our zero-
waste-to-landfill criteria in fiscal 2021.

We also work to reduce food waste 
in our office buildings. At our 
headquarters, 89% of total waste was 
recycled and 0.58% went to landfill. 

We actively participate in industry, nonprofit 
and government groups focused on food 
loss and waste reduction as well as surplus 
food recovery, including AMERIPEN, the 
Food Waste Reduction Alliance, the 
Consumer Brands Association, ReFED, 
Consumer Goods Forum Food Waste 
Coalition of Action, MBOLD, and the U.S. 
Food Waste and Loss 2030 Champions.

We are part of an industry effort to 
standardize food date labels to improve 
clarity about food quality and safety and 
reduce the amount of good food that’s 
thrown away. As of June 2021, we have 
updated 100% of our U.S. packages.

General Mills is committed to increasing 
surplus food recovery, especially among 
consumer-facing food businesses — 
grocery stores, restaurants and other food 
outlets. These organizations collectively 
account for 28% of all food waste, roughly 
50 billion pounds (more than 20 million 
metric tons) per year in the U.S. alone.*

During the past four years, our global 
investments in food recovery technology 
have empowered more than 43,000 
retail and foodservice locations to 
participate in systematic food rescue.

General Mills provides philanthropic support 
to leading nonprofits that makes it possible 
for food manufacturers, grocers, restaurants, 
distributors, trucking companies and other 
organizations to donate surplus food so 
it can be distributed to people in need.

fiscal 2021, we shifted management 

of our audit program to in-house and 

expanded the scope to additional 

geographies and business segments. 

We also simplified our program 

by eliminating the self-assessment 

questionnaire and only requiring a 

SMETA compliant audit to decrease 

supplier time and resource requirements 

and improve the effectiveness of the 

program. All suppliers are expected 

to comply and participate in the 

program by submitting a SMETA-

compliant audit when requested.

Partnering with  
our suppliers to 
address COVID-19
At the start of the COVID-19 

pandemic, General Mills wanted 

to ensure the health and safety of 

workers at all levels in our supply 

chain. We broadly shared a list of 

best practices and guidelines with 

our suppliers on how General Mills 

was approaching COVID-19 safety 

protocols in our own facilities. Our 

Sourcing and Quality teams came 

together to host a food safety 

webinar that was available to all 

external manufacturing sites and 

direct suppliers. The webinar was 

created to share human and food 

safety best practices in light of the 

changes that COVID-19 brought to 

our manufacturing operations. We 

began to work in new and different 

ways, such as allowing for virtual 

audits and product startups so 

we could continue working in a 

safe and productive environment. 

Finally, we implemented a supplier 

appreciation and recognition 

program to show our gratitude 

and support to our suppliers who 

were working through a situation 

that was changing day by day.

Global inclusion

Our approach 
General Mills recognizes the imperative 

of using our scale to drive sustainable 

and meaningful change. We are 

dedicated to becoming a reflection 

of the world we seek, where equity 

and inclusion are a reality for us all. 

We know that meaningful change 

takes time — and it will take all of 

us to make progress at both the 

systemic and individual levels — and 

we are committed to continuing this 

critical journey with the strong belief 

that we can be a force for good.

We continue to build on the positive 

actions we’ve taken for decades, and 

we recognize we still have a lot of 

work to do. We have committed to 

lead differently, vocally and tirelessly. 

The issues of social injustice are broad 

and complex, and we are focusing 

our efforts where our expertise can 

make the greatest impact: equitable 

food access, equity in education 

and equity in representation. 

Our goal is to foster a culture of 
inclusion and belonging that allows 

all our employees to thrive. Ensuring 

diversity of perspectives is core to 

our business strategy. We actively 

cultivate a culture that acknowledges, 

respects and values all dimensions 

of diversity — including gender, 

race, sexual orientation, ability, 

backgrounds and beliefs. We are 

committed to advancing racial equity 

within and outside our workplace.

Our strategy: Using our global inclusion 
framework, we will advance engagement  

around the world, leveraging data to assess 

as we continue to foster a culture of 

progress and hold ourselves accountable  

inclusion and belonging at General Mills.

suppliers in the U.S. for more than 

50 years, providing opportunity to 

underrepresented groups while fostering 

job creation and economic development.* 

By requiring businesses to be certified

through third-party authentication. These 

inclusion efforts also support General 

Mills by delivering innovation, agility, 

cost savings and market insights about 

our increasingly diverse consumers. 

Our Supplier Diversity Team, which is 

embedded in our Global Supply Chain 

organization, builds partnerships across 

the company to match diverse suppliers 

with business needs and opportunities. 

The team integrates supplier diversity 

into the standard sourcing process, trains 

all sourcing buyers and provides tools to 

advance the program. Sourcing category 

managers incorporate diversity into their 

strategic plans to drive progress and 

share results with sourcing leadership. 

Our approach in recent years has 

evolved by applying robust data, 

standard processes and business 

integration that mirrors our 

sourcing organization workflow.

Our actions: We have expanded our

recovery?
Also known as food rescue, 

food recovery is the practice of

surplus food that would otherwise 

go to waste from places such 

as restaurants, grocery stores, 

produce markets, or dining 

facilities and distributing it to 

local emergency food programs.

Resources saved by recovering food
Food recovery reduces GHG emissions and conserves natural resources. General Mills donated 49 million pounds of food in fiscal 2021. Based on 

the ReFED Insights Engine Impact Calculator (see next page), the impact of keeping that food out of landfills is equivalent to 1,925 passenger 

vehicles driven for 1 year. Learn more in the Planet section of this report.

we leverage our philanthropy and 

General Mills' deep food system expertise 

to expand surplus food recovery. 

Our efforts and investments have 

resulted in grocery stores, restaurants 

and thousands of other food outlets 

around the globe gaining and adopting 

systematic food recovery solutions so 

that their good surplus food can now 

be used to nourish hungry people 

and does not end up in landfills.

Since food waste and loss occur from 

"farm-to-fork” and impact growers, 

families, communities, the environment 

and businesses, we engage with a 

wide variety of partners to advance 

positive change. We bring a systems 

lens and take a collective impact

Advancing racial equity

We are proud of our company’s longstanding work and deep commitment to using our philanthropy as an added lever to advance racial equity. We work in targeted ways to use 

our resources and influence to bring an end to racial disparities in social outcomes, including student educational achievement and food insecurity. Listed below are examples of 

our efforts and impact.

31 years 

hosting Dr. Martin Luther  

King Jr. Holiday Breakfast

In 1991, General Mills developed and hosted our first Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 

Holiday Breakfast. Thirty years later, the event is attended by thousands of 

people each year to contemplate and celebrate the legacy of Dr. King. Since 

that time, General Mills and its Foundation have provided more than $6 million  

in support to the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) to help Black students 

get to and through college.

in charitable giving by General Mills and its 

Foundation over the last five years (fiscal 2017-

2021) to nonprofits in the Twin Cities (greater 

Minneapolis and St. Paul metro area), including 

$18 million toward promoting equitable food 

access and equity in K-12 education. 

As a cofounder of the Minnesota Business Coalition 
for Racial Equity (MBCRE), we are helping the 
business sector sharpen and accelerate actions 
to improve conditions and advance equitable 
outcomes with and for Black Minnesotans. The 

coalition’s approach seeks systemic changes via public policy, 
philanthropy, allyship and workplace environments. 

General Mills was 
recognized in the 
Points of Light 2021 
Civic 50 report for 
helping to advance  
work on social justice 
through the MBCRE. 

SUPPORTING
diverse and minority-
led nonprofits

The General Mills philanthropy team continues to work to ensure our charitable giving helps support organizations with missions and 

practices that advance racial equity and whose organizational makeup — including leaders (e.g., Executive Director, Board of Directors) and 

staff — is racially diverse and representative of the diverse communities they serve. In our 2021 review of our philanthropic portfolio in the 

Twin Cities, we integrated new practices to explicitly measure and review dimensions of organizational diversity, equity and inclusion as part 

of our grantmaking application to ensure equitable distribution and investment levels across grantmaking portfolios. Our approach includes supporting community-driven 

solutions guided by minority-led organizations, including:

*See below for GHG calculation methodology and definitions. Scope 1 and 2 totals differ from the Key manufacturing metrics to 
the left as the data in this table include those locations as well as other wholly owned or controlled facilities globally (such as 
offices and Häagen-Dazs shops) as well as fleet vehicles. 
**General Mills uses the market-based emissions methodology for Scope 2 emissions, which considers any contractual 
instruments that may be used in competitive energy markets, such as green tariffs, renewable certificates, or PPAs. Both 
market-based and location-based emissions are reported in our CDP Climate disclosure..

GHG calculation methodology

We work with Quantis to calculate our global GHG emissions footprint each fiscal year, 
following the guidelines of the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
This footprint covers our complete value chain. For our 2030 science-based target, we define 
our emissions boundaries in alignment with the Science-based Target Initiative (SBTi):

Scope 1: Direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled 
or owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, 
furnaces, vehicles). General Mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions within 
its organizational boundary. 

Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions associated with the purchase of electricity, steam, heat, 
or cooling. General Mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions within its 
organizational boundary. 

General Mills uses the market-based methodology for calculation of our Scope 2 emissions, 
which considers any contractual instruments that may be used in competitive energy 
markets, such as green tariffs, renewable certificates, or PPAs.

Scope 3: Indirect GHG emissions occurring from assets not owned or controlled by the 
reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain. Scope 3 
emissions include all sources not within an organization’s scope 1 and 2 boundary, as outlined 
by the GHG Protocol. General Mills uses operational control to categorize those emissions 
within its organizational boundary. 

Consistent with SBTi guidelines, our targets focus on the categories of GHG emissions that 
are the most impactful and actionable for General Mills, and exclude emissions such as low-
volume ingredients, capital goods, employee commuting, franchises, downstream warehouse 
and storage at retail, consumer trips to store and end of life (consumer food waste).

Scope 1, 2 and 3 data in the above table were externally verified by Apex Companies, LLC, 
and our verification letter can be found on our website. We work to continually update our 
methodology, visibility and accuracy, and update results as appropriate each year. Our 
Fiscal 2020 baseline will be re-verified if there is a change greater than 5%.

Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are 
most commonly used in small quantities 
for closed-loop refrigeration systems 
and occasional fumigation activities. 
ODS emissions are strictly regulated.

Air emissions primarily include particulate 
matter and organic compounds from 
ingredient handling, cooking and drying, 
as well as emissions associated with fuel 
combustion. Our production facilities are 
governed by applicable regulations as well 
as our compliance management program.

We do not discharge untreated sanitary 
wastewater to land or surface waters 
at any of our locations. Wastewater 
discharges primarily consist of organic 
matter from ingredient handling, food 
production and cleaning processes. 
Our production facilities are governed 
by applicable regulations as well as our 
compliance management program.

There were no significant spills 
at our manufacturing locations 
during the reporting period.

The quantity of hazardous waste produced 
and shipped is insignificant relative to the 
amount of solid waste generated at General 
Mills. Hazardous waste shipping and disposal 
is restricted by government regulations.

No water bodies are significantly 
affected by company discharges. Our 
production facilities are governed by 
applicable regulations as well as our 
compliance management program.

global operations.

Water Management

FB-PF-140a.1

Total water consumption in FY21 in our owned production facilities was 13,607,000 cubic meters. Approximately 7% of our water 
withdrawals are from water-stressed areas. See CDP Water for details.

FB-PF-140a.2

No incidents related to water quality and/or quality permits, standards or regulations in FY21.

FB-PF-140a.3

Water issues are local, so we take a risk-based approach to address risks in priority watersheds across our global supply chain.  
Our goal is to champion the activation of water stewardship plans for the company’s most material and at-risk watersheds.  
See Water stewardship and CDP Water for details. 

Food Safety

FB-PF-250a.1

nutrition criteria grounded in regulations and dietary guidance and measures across our global portfolio. See Nutrition for details.

Product Labeling 
and Marketing

FB-PF-270a.2

We disclose the presence of bioengineered ingredients (GMOs) on our U.S. packages under the National Bioengineered Food 
Disclosure Standard for all applicable FDA and USDA regulated products. In FY21 almost all of our applicable product labels disclosed 
this information, with all products in compliance prior to the 2022 compliance deadline. We are also voluntarily labeling all products 
that contain highly refined BE ingredients, with expected completion by Summer 2023.

FB-PF-410a.2

FB-PF-430a.1

FB-PF-430a.2

We continually work to reduce the environmental impact of packaging by increasing use of recycled and recyclable materials, 
innovating to make our materials better, and leading through external collaboration. See Packaging for details.

In FY20, we achieved our goal to sustainably source our 10 priority ingredients (representing approximately 40% of our annual raw 
material purchases).

In FY21, 15 of our owned locations, 30 of our co-packers and 190 of our Tier 1 suppliers were audited. See Responsible sourcing for 
additional details.

Ingredient Sourcing

FB-PF-440a.1

Our footprint consists of approximately 60 key ingredient and manufacturing watersheds that are the most critical for operations.  
Of those, 10 are prioritized as high risk. See Water stewardship and CDP Water for details.

FB-PF-440a.2

In FY20, we achieved our goal to sustainably source 10 priority ingredients: cocoa, vanilla, oats, U.S sugar beets, U.S. wheat, U.S. corn 
(dry milled), U.S dairy (raw fluid milk), fiber packaging, sugarcane and palm oil. We have now shifted our focus to programs that 
regenerate the planet and create positive outcomes for people. See Ingredient sourcing and Regenerative agriculture for details.
