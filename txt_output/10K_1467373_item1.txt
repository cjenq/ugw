People 

Overview 

We are a talent- and innovation-led organization with over 624,000 people as of August 31, 2021, whose skills and specialization are a significant source of competitive differentiation. We serve clients at any given time in more than 120 countries, with offices and operations in 50 countries. The majority of our people are in India, the Philippines and the U.S. We have a culture of shared success, which is defined as success for our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. That culture is built upon four tangible building blocks&#8212;our beliefs, our behaviors, the way we develop and reward our people and the way we do business. 

Our Beliefs and Behaviors 

Our leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people: 

&#8226; always do the right thing, in every decision and action; 

&#8226; lead with excellence, confidence and humility, as demonstrated by being a learner, building great teams and being naturally collaborative; 

&#8226; exemplify client-centricity and a commitment to client value creation; 

&#8226; act as a true partner, to each other, our clients, our ecosystem and our communities; 

&#8226; care deeply for all our people to help them achieve their aspirations professionally and personally; 

##TABLE_START 

ACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-K 

Item 1. Business 7 

##TABLE_END

&#8226; live our unwavering commitment to inclusion, diversity and equality, as demonstrated by personal impact and overall results; 

&#8226; have the courage to change and the ability to bring our people along the journey; and 

&#8226; actively innovate &#8212;looking across Accenture, at what we are doing for clients and externally to partners, competitors, start-ups, clients, academia and analysts&#8212;to learn, respectfully challenge our assumptions and apply the innovation, and cultivate and reward our people for doing the same. 

Listening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities, and that they experience a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment. We do this on an ongoing basis across various channels, including surveys and forums. One of our surveys, our Conduct Counts Survey, which measures how our people experience our culture, shows that 87% of our global respondents believe they can work to their potential because they are in an environment where they are treated with respect and in an appropriate manner. 

Our commitment to inclusion and diversity unleashes innovation and we believe creates an environment where all of our people have an opportunity to feel they belong, advance and thrive. In connection with our priorities around inclusion and diversity, we set goals, share them publicly, collect data to continuously improve and hold our leaders accountable. We now have more than 275,000 women, representing 46% of our workforce, which is tracking well against our goal of 50% by 2025. And, after achieving our goal of 25% women managing directors by the end of fiscal year 2020, we set a new goal of 30% by 2025. We are also making progress against our 2025 race and ethnicity goals in the U.S., the U.K, and South Africa, which we announced in 2020. 

Through the entire talent lifecycle, we are committed to being inclusive and diverse&#8212;from discovering, to hiring, to developing and advancing our people. This commitment extends to equal pay. Pay equity at Accenture means that our people receive pay that is fair and consistent when considering similarity of work, location and tenure at career level. We conduct an annual pay equity review, and our last review was conducted in February 2021. As of February 1, 2021, we have dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity for women compared to men in every country where we operate. By race and ethnicity, we likewise have dollar-for-dollar, 100% pay equity in countries where we collect this data (the U.S., the U.K. and South Africa). 

The Way We Develop and Reward Our People 

We invested $900 million in continuous learning and development so our people remain highly relevant. With our digital learning platform, Accenture Connected Learning, we delivered over 31 million training hours, an increase of 43% compared with fiscal 2020, with an average of approximately 60 hours of training per person. 

We promoted more than 120,000 people in fiscal 2021. In addition, we paid a one-time bonus to all of our people below managing director to recognize their contributions and dedication to our clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We balance our supply of skills with changes in client demand. We do this through adjusting hiring and managing our attrition (both voluntary and involuntary). In fiscal 2021, we increased our workforce by approximately 118,000 people. For fiscal 2021, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 14%, up from 12% in fiscal 2020. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19% up from 17% in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. 

Accenture&#8217;s total rewards consist of cash compensation, equity and a wide range of benefits. Our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people&#8217;s skills, contributions and career progression. Base salary, bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live. Certain rewards, like equity and bonuses, are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company. As our people advance in their careers, they have greater opportunities to be rewarded. 

The Way We Do Business 

At Accenture, our people care deeply about doing the right thing. Together, we have proven that we can succeed&#8212;providing value to our clients and shareholders and opportunities for our people&#8212;while being a powerful force for good. Our shared commitment to operating with the highest ethical standards and making a positive difference in everything we do is what makes Accenture special. We believe in transparency, that transparency builds trust, and that we must earn the trust of our clients, our people, our partners and our communities each and every day. 

Our Code of Business Ethics is organized into six fundamental behaviors: Make Your Conduct Count; Comply with Laws; Deliver for Our Clients; Protect People, Information and Our Business; Run Our Business Responsibly; and Be a Good Corporate Citizen. It applies to all our people&#8212;regardless of their title or location. With our Code of Business Ethics, we want to help our people make ethical behavior a natural part of what we do every day&#8212;with each other, our clients, our partners and our communities. 

Our Health, Safety and Well-Being 

We are committed to creating a place where people can be successful both professionally and personally. We take a holistic view of well-being&#8212;including physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being&#8212;providing specially defined programs and 

##TABLE_START 

ACCENTURE 2021 FORM 10-K

##TABLE_END

practices to support this holistic view. 

In FY21, as it relates to COVID-19, we have supported our people with the expansion of critical programs, including, in many counties, 24/7 telemedicine, care-at-home services, proctored distance learning for school-aged children, virtual childcare, enhanced insurance coverage, mental health support and testing and vaccination services. The pandemic has negatively affected many people&#8217;s mental health around the globe. We used new digital tools and initiatives to help employees cope with the demands and stresses of the compounding crises, and to strengthen their mental resilience. Those programs include access to in-person and virtual counseling and support, to digital tools like Calm and Wysa, to our Mental Health Ally program and to our many Thrive Global programs&#8212;Thriving Together, Thrive Reset and Thriving Mind&#8212;which have collectively been completed by over 152,000 of our people and bring science-based solutions to lower stress, enhance well-being and productivity, and build resilience and belonging. 

To promote health and safety and to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, we actively connected our people and their families to effective testing in multiple ways&#8212;home testing kits, in office testing, and through pharmacies close to where they live. We have administered vaccinations in ten countries, including the U.S., India and the Philippines, through Accenture-hosted or organized onsite events and clinics. We have also provided paid time off for all our people to receive their full vaccine course, as well as their eligible dependents. 

Environmental Sustainability 

For more than a decade, we have continually set challenging environmental goals for ourselves, innovating our approach to environmental sustainability and making strategic investments. In alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement, we&#8217;ve pledged to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5&#176; Celsius by joining the more than 400 companies that have signed the UN Global Compact&#8217;s Business Ambition for 1.5&#176; Pledge to date. We have also pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2025, move to zero waste and plan for water risk. 

As a professional services company, the most significant aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our locations and travel. To meet our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2025: 

&#8226; we plan to meet our office energy needs with 100% renewable electricity by 2023&#8212;in September 2021, we announced that we had reached 50% renewable electricity&#8212;and equip our people to make climate smart travel decisions; 

&#8226; we will require 90% of our key suppliers to disclose their environmental targets and actions being taken to reduce emissions by 2025; and 

&#8226; to address remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal solutions that will directly remove carbon from the atmosphere. 

To move towards zero waste, we will reuse or recycle 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all of our office furniture, by 2025, and post-pandemic we have committed to eliminating single-use plastics in our locations. 

To plan for water risk, we are developing plans to reduce the impact of flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas. 

Global Delivery Capability 

A key differentiator is our global delivery capability, powered by the world&#8217;s largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations Centers. This allows us to bring the right people at the right time to our clients from anywhere in the world&#8212;both in physical and virtual working environments&#8212;a capability that is particularly crucial as business needs and conditions change rapidly. Our global approach provides scalable innovation; standardized processes, methods and tools; automation and artificial intelligence; industry expertise and specialized capabilities; cost advantages; foreign language fluency; proximity to clients; and time zone advantages&#8212;to deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model supports all parts of our business to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions. 

Innovation and Intellectual Property 

We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas and leveraging emerging technologies and we see innovation as a source of competitive advantage. We use our investment in R&#38;D&#8212;on which we spent $1.1 billion, $871 million, and $800 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively&#8212;to help clients address new realities in the marketplace and to face the future with confidence. 

##TABLE_START

##TABLE_END

Our innovation experts work with clients across the world to imagine their future, build and co-create innovative business strategies and technology solutions, and then scale those solutions to sustain innovation. We harness our unique intellectual property to deliver these innovation services. 

We leverage patent, trade secret and copyright laws as well as contractual arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect the intellectual property in our innovative services and solutions. These include our proprietary platforms, software, reusable knowledge capital, and other innovations. We also have policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as our clients, partners, vendors and others. As of August 31, 2021, we had a portfolio of more than 8,200 patents and pending patent applications worldwide. 

We believe our combination of people, assets and capabilities, including our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs, makes Accenture one of the leading strategic innovation partners for our clients. We have deep expertise in innovation consulting including strategy, culture change and building new business models through to long-term technology innovation, which creates the products and markets of the future. 

This is all supported by our Innovation Architecture, which includes Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture Labs as well as our Studios, Innovation Centers and Delivery Centers. Our research and thought leadership teams help identify market, technology and industry trends. Accenture Ventures partners with and invests in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. Accenture Labs incubate and prototype new concepts through applied research and development projects. Within this, the Technology Incubation Group incubates and applies emerging technology innovation to business architectures, including blockchain, extended reality and quantum. 

To protect Accenture&#8217;s brands, we rely on intellectual property laws and trademark registrations held around the world. Trademarks appearing in this report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Accenture Global Services Limited, Accenture Global Solutions Limited, or third parties, as applicable. 

Competition 

Accenture operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. We compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer&#8212;but we believe no other company offers the full range of services at scale that Accenture does, which uniquely positions us in a highly competitive market. Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 

Our competitors include large multinational IT service providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers; off-shore IT service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India; accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other IT services and solutions; solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agencies, engineering services providers and technology start-ups; and in-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm. 

We believe Accenture competes successfully in the marketplace because: 

&#8226; We are focused on delivering 360&#176; value, which we define as the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill our clients&#8217; employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients; 

&#8226; We are a trusted partner with long-term client relationships and a proven track record for delivering on large, complex programs that drive tangible value; 

&#8226; We provide a broad range of services with our unique approach to bring integrated service teams at scale and have a significant presence in every major geographic market, enabling us to leverage our global expertise in a local context and deliver tangible value; 

&#8226; We have deep industry and cross-industry expertise , which enable us to accelerate value as clients transform their products, customer experiences and business operations; 

&#8226; Our industry-leading Innovation Architecture &#8212;including Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture Labs as well as our Studios, Innovation Centers and Delivery Centers&#8212;reflects our commitment to continuous innovation and enables us to rapidly identify, incubate, and scale emerging technology solutions for our clients; 

&#8226; The breadth and scale of our technology capabilities, combined with our strong relationships with our technology ecosystem partners, enable us to help clients transform and re-platform in a sustainable way at speed; and 

&#8226; Our goal is to recruit the most talented people in our markets, and we have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity, which creates an environment that unleashes innovation, and a world-class learning organization that helps us continuously invest in the development of our people.
