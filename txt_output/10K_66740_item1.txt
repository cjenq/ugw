General 

&#8203; 

3M is a diversified technology company with a global presence in the following businesses : Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M is among the leading manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. Most 3M products involve expertise in product development, manufacturing and marketing, and are subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other technologically oriented companies.

&#8203; 

Business Segments 

&#8203; 

3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics, Health Care, and Consumer. 3M&#8217;s four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Financial information and other disclosures relating to 3M&#8217;s business segments and operations in major geographic areas are provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

&#8203; 

As described in Note 19, effective in the first quarter of 2020, the Company changed its business segment reporting in its continuing effort to improve the alignment of businesses around markets and customers. Additionally, the Company consolidated the way it presents geographic area net sales by providing an aggregate Americas geographic region (combining former United States and Latin America and Canada areas). Also, effective in the second quarter of 2020, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M&#8217;s chief operating decision maker changed and, as a result, the Company&#8217;s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss has been updated. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.

Distribution 

&#8203; 

3M products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through numerous e-commerce and traditional wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world. Management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3M and its products &#8212; a confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales representatives &#8212; has contributed significantly to 3M&#8217;s position in the marketplace and to its growth.

&#8203; 

Resources 

&#8203; 

Human Capital 

&#8203; 

On December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 95,000 people (full-time equivalents), with approximately 40,000 employed in the United States and 55,000 employed internationally. The ability to recruit, retain, develop, protect, and fairly compensate its global workforce are enablers of 3M&#8217;s success. This includes four general categories of focus: Health and Safety; Development; Diversity, Equity and Inclusion; and Compensation and Benefits.

&#8203; 

Health and Safety

&#8203; 

3M is committed to the safety, health, and well-being of its employees. The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to raise safety and health standards, visiting sites to identify and manage environmental health and safety risks; evaluating compliance with regulatory requirements and 3M policy; and maintaining a global security operation for the protection of facilities and people on 3M sites. 3M also promotes a culture of health and well-being through disease prevention programs, on-site clinical services, employee assistance programs, and comprehensive health care benefits. 

&#8203; 

Development

&#8203; 

Developing employees contributes to growing 3M&#8217;s business. 3M maintains talent and succession planning processes, including regular review by the Company&#8217;s chief executive officer (CEO) and reporting up through the Board of Directors. The Company has a suite of high-potential leadership development programs which brings a consistent approach to leadership development. 3M also has development programs for managers and supervisors and provides learning opportunities for all employees. With the Company&#8217;s global online employee learning platform, employees are able to access unique, just-in-time development resources in over 15 languages to support their career aspirations and advance their skills. 

&#8203; 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

&#8203; 

A diverse, global workforce and inclusive culture that provides fair and equitable opportunities helps 3M remain competitive, advance its innovation culture, and serve customers. 3M focuses on attracting and advancing top talent and has publicly committed to advance global diversity in management across all dimensions, with additional specific goals to continue advancing pay equity and to increase the Company&#8217;s diversity with underrepresented groups. 3M supports these values with an internal CEO Inclusion Council, a forum led by senior management to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Company also plans to invest $50 million over 2020 to 2025 to address racial opportunity gaps through workforce development initiatives in the communities in which its employees live and 3M business operates. 

&#8203; 

Compensation and Benefits

&#8203; 

In addition to a professional work environment that promotes innovation and rewards performance, 3M&#8217;s total compensation for employees includes a variety of components that support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning a base salary, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to the Company&#8217;s goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives. Through its global pay philosophy, principles and consistent implementation, 3M is committed to providing fair and equitable pay for employees. Eligible full-time employees in the United States also have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; a 3M employee stock purchase plan; and other resources. Some of these benefits can also be available to regular part-time employees who work at least 20 hours a week. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, 

such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.

&#8203; 

Raw Materials 

&#8203; 

In 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic caused fluctuations in supply markets. Generally, as demand for certain COVID-related products surged, 3M saw a corresponding tightening in supply and some degree of price inflation in associated markets. Within the supply chain of less essential products, 3M experienced raw material price deflation as economies slowed and certain producers scaled back or idled operations. Conversely, as markets re-opened and demand increased, the Company experienced raw material price inflation with some level of stabilization late in the year.

&#8203; 

The Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. Overall, on a consolidated basis, 3M experienced net raw material price deflation in 2020. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development as well as qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts and price protection agreements. In addition, 3M evaluates suppliers&#8217; conformance with environmental and social compliance requirements.

&#8203; 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#8203; 

The Company&#8217;s products are sold around the world under various trademarks. The Company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous U.S. and foreign patents. The Company&#8217;s research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents or trade secrets. Patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

&#8203; 

The Company believes that its trademarks, patents, and trade secrets provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. In general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the Company as a whole or to any of the Company&#8217;s business segments.

&#8203; 

Government Regulation and Environmental Law Compliance 

&#8203; 

The Company&#8217;s business operations are subject to various governmental regulations in the U.S. and internationally, including, among others, those related to product liability, antitrust, intellectual property, environmental, tax, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws, U.S. trade sanctions, regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and similar foreign agencies, U.S. federal healthcare program-related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act, anti-kickback laws and the Sunshine Act.

&#8203; 

3M&#8217;s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws and regulations around the world. The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to &#8220;Environmental Matters and Litigation&#8221; in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).

&#8203; 

Environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company&#8217;s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.

&#8203; 

In 2020, 3M expended approximately $55 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality 

improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $400 million for 2021 and 2022 in aggregate.

&#8203; 

Although an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

&#8203; 

Information about our Executive Officers 

&#8203; 

Following is a list of the executive officers of 3M, and their age, present position, the year elected to their present position and other positions they have held during the past five years. No family relationships exist among any of the executive officers named, nor is 

there any undisclosed arrangement or understanding pursuant to which any person was selected as an officer. This information is presented in the table below as of the date of the 10-K filing (February 4, 2021).
